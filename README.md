Maybe one day we'll go open source.
Gotta figure out some password stuff first.

## TODO

- [x] Migrate dev.jacksonmoore.com.au to jacksonmoore.com.au
- [x] Publish the repo to docker hub (private)
- [x] Set build rules and tags
- [x] Docker compose to use the published images rather than local build in production (development to remain using local). Use docker-compose-prod.yaml
- [x] Set up ouroboros/watchtower for continuous deployment
- [x] Look into TravisCI
- [x] Setup TravisCI with tests using curl and grep
- [x] Set up hooks to build on docker
